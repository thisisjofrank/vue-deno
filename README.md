# Deno and Vue.js
## A dinosaur app built with Vue 3, Vite and TypeScript

This demo is a simple Vue.js app. It uses the Vue 3 framework, Vite as the build tool, and TypeScript as the language. The app is a simple dinosaur app that displays a list of dinosaurs and allows the user to add a new dinosaur to the list.

You can follow along with the tutorial on the [Deno Docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/tutorials/how_to_with_npm/vue/).

## Run the app

To run the app, you need to have [Deno](https://deno.land/) installed on your machine. You can install Deno by running the following command, or following the instructions in the [Deno docs](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

Once you have Deno installed, you can run the app with the following command:

```bash
deno task dev
```
